In celebration of the World Cup in Russia, I've decided to take on Betfair's World Cup Datathon. See below my series of posts outlining how I built my models.


This is part of a series of posts on the World Cup Betfair datathon. See the links to others below.

# Predictions
The following are my actual predictions, based on each model. 

```{r predict, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(pacman)
p_load(tidyverse)

# Load files
path <- here::here("projects", "world-cup-2018", "submissions")
files <- list.files(path)

dat <- paste0(path, "/", files) %>%
  map(read_csv) %>%
  map2_dfr(.y = files, ~ .x %>% mutate(model = str_remove(.y, "james_day_"),
                                       model = str_remove(model, ".csv"),
                                       group = str_extract(match_id, "[[a-z]]"),
                                       group_match = as.integer(str_extract(match_id, "\\d+"))))


dat
```
# Results
I'll post these after the fact.
