# Load libraries
library(pacman)
pacman::p_load(fitzRoy, tidyverse, formattable,

dat_list <- read_rds(here::here("data", "raw-data", "AFLM.rds"))

# Get predictions for current round and present as table
dat_list$predictions %>%
  filter(Round.Number == last(dat_list$elo$Round.Number + 1)) %>%
  select(-Time, -Round.Number) %>%
  mutate_at("Probability", formattable::percent, digits = 1) %>%
  formattable(list(
    Home.Team = formatter(
      "span", style =
        ~ style("font-weight" = ifelse(Probability >= 0.501, "bold", NA))
    ),
    Away.Team = formatter(
      "span", style =
        ~ style("font-weight" = ifelse(Probability <= 0.499, "bold", NA))
