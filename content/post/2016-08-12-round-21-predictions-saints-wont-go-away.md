While I keep writing that our top 8 [has been set for awhile](http://plussixoneblog.com/2016/05/05/the-round-7-rule/), the chance of someone jumping into the finals hasn't [gone away](http://plussixoneblog.com/2016/08/10/round-21-simulations/). The Saints are still a 17% of making it and the order of our top 4 in particular is still very fluid meaning there is still plenty of [important](http://plussixoneblog.com/2016/06/16/beyond-the-8-point-game-estimating-match-importance-in-the-afl/) games!

### Round Predictions

![round21](http://plussixoneblog.com/img/2016/08/round21.png)

The [ELO model](http://plussixoneblog.com/2016/05/23/my-elo-rating-system-explained/) is relatively confident in most matches this week. With our only top 8 matchups (Hawthron v Kangaroos and GWS v West Coast) coming between teams at the top of the rankings versus those near the bottom, we see a fairly big discrepancy in relative rankings this week. In fact, the discrepancy is so big that 5 of our matches are predicting relatively comfortable wins to the away team, despite [our HGA boost](http://plussixoneblog.com/2016/05/23/my-elo-rating-system-explained/). Next week I might take a look at how well my model historically does during this period but it could be argued - [as Figuring Footy has](http://figuringfooty.com/2016/08/12/2016-round-21-tips-and-predictions/) - that there is a lot more noise during these periods as teams start playing for different reasons other than making finals.

### Match Importance

**St Kilda v Sydney, Sat 7:25pm, Etihad.**

As all of our 'jump into the top 8' sides have fallen during important games this week, the Saints remain our last hope. They currently have a [17% chance](http://plussixoneblog.com/2016/08/10/round-21-simulations/) according to our latest sims but this week is pretty crucial. A win sees them make finals in 50% of simulations, while a loss drops that to 9%. For Sydney, a win almost ties up their top 4 chances. Considering they are sitting clear on top of our rating system, while the Saints [remain a below average team](http://plussixoneblog.com/2016/08/10/round-21-simulations/), we see this as a pretty easy win for the Swans.  _**Sydney (66% chance) by 26 points. **_

**Hawthorn v North Melbourne, Sat 2:20pm, MCG.**

With the Hawks shock loss last week, this game looms as super important for their top 4 chances. Currently they sit at [74% chances](http://plussixoneblog.com/2016/08/10/round-21-simulations/) but a loss sees that drop to 54%. For North, they are still our most likely side to drop out of the top 8 and so need a win to avoid that potential. Lose this week and their 77% shot drops down to 59%, while a win basically guarantees finals. Lots on the line! Unfortunately for North, our ELO model is [as our 8th best team](http://plussixoneblog.com/2016/08/10/round-21-simulations/), although the last 2 weeks have seen the Hawks drop down to 4th spot on our ratings table. Nonetheless, they should get the job done.  _**Hawthorn (61% chance) by 19 points. **_
