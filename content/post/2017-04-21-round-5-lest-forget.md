It was after the ANZAC day game last year that I [launched](http://plussixoneblog.com/2016/04/27/the-first-last-post/) plusSixOne to much fanfare!

### Ratings update

Looking at our ratings graph below - we can see some clusters starting to emerge. Up the top we have Geelong, GWS and the Crows as our standout top 3. A group of 4 in West Coast, Bulldogs, Port and Sydney are struggling to emerge to join them. After that - our clump of 7 average teams are remarkably close. In fact, if any of those teams played each other on a neutral venue, we wouldn't favour any team by more than 9 points. It makes for an interesting race for those bottom spots in finals as the year progresses.
