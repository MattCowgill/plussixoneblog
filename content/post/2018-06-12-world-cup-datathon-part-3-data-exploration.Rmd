One thing we notice is the date range - from 1998 through to the end of last year. There are also some missing data in the odd's columns - around 5k matches. I wonder if that's just older games? 

```{r plot_betfair, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
betfair_plot <- betfair_dat %>%
  ggplot(aes(as.yearmon(date), fill = is.na(draw_betfair_odds))) + 
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Number of games per month") + 
  theme_minimal()
betfair_plot
```

So, yep - it does look like mostly older games. But also in recent years there are games that don't have odds. 

```{r}
betfair_plot + 
  facet_wrap(~tournament)

```
