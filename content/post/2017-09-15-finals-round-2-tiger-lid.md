### Ratings

Our top 2 remained unchanged after expected wins last week. Sydney remains our highest rated team but need to win 3 away games from here. Richmond shot up our rankings with their big win - jumping into the top 3 and displacing Geelong, who drop down to 6th. The train is certainly building for the Tiger army, although there is a pretty big gap between Adelaide and Sydney and the remaining teams.

### Tips

Sydney looks a clear favourite here, despite being the away team. They are pretty clear leaders in our ratings and Geelong have been falling - particularly after last week. Our model is tipping a pretty comfortable win here.

For Saturdays matchup, things aren't as clear. West Coast were unexpected winners last week but come up against at GWS team that has been hovering as a second tier team for most of the season. GWS slight favourites but should be a close one.

### Simulations

Adelaide fans can probably start booking their flights if you believe our ratings! The Crows make the finals in two-thirds of all simulations. They win nearly 40% of all our simulations. As the highest rated team, Sydney looms as the biggest challenger. Their big risk is that they must win 3 away games from here. Richmond is the next favourite after these guys - hopefully a 14% premiership chance doesn't equal to a lid blowing off?
