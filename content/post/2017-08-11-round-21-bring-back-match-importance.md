Getting to the business end of the season. There are still quite a few spots open for finals so this shapes as a pretty important round. I've included some match importance ratings this week so read on to find out which games matter!

## Match Importance

I posted our simulations earlier in the week - find them [here](http://plussixoneblog.com/2017/08/07/post-round-20-simulations/) - but it's safe to say there are some important matchups this week. Last year, I introduce the idea of [match importance](http://plussixoneblog.com/2016/06/16/beyond-the-8-point-game-estimating-match-importance-in-the-afl/) and I'll bring it back this week. Below you can see each game ranked by it's match importance. Essentially this is the sum of the impact a game has on each teams chances of finishing in various finals positions.

This weekend we see that St Kilda v Melbourne has the biggest swing - causing a collective 96% swing in top 8 chances for either team! The Richmond v Geelong game has big impacts on Geelong's minor premiership chances but also both teams Top 4 aspirations.

## Tipping

Onto this weeks tips and we can see that some of those important games are quite close in our estimations. The Bulldogs v GWS game, which has huge implications for the Bulldogs finals chances, as well as GWS locking up top 4 or even staying within a shot of a minor premiership. We give GWS a slight edge but, concerningly, all other tippers over on [The Squiggle](http://squiggle.com.au) see it the other way!

Interestingly, our most important match of the round is also our closest in our predictions! St Kilda v Melbourne has big impacts on both teams finals changes and we are given Melbourne the edge slightly by 8 points, only really due to being the nominal home team.
