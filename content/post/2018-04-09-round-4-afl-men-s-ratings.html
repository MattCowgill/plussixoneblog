<p>Not a whole lot of movement at the top, with Adelaide, Sydney, GWS, Richmond and Port remaining in the top tier of teams. These teams are all projected around 16 wins and ~80% chance of finals at this early stage, with Adelaide poking it’s nose out in front.</p>
<p>The pack following is lead by Geelong and rounded out by West Coast, Melbourne and Hawthorn. This cluster all sits at around ~13 projected wins and ~55% chance of finals.</p>
<p>Of the rest, Collingwood looks the most likely to jump into that next tier, sitting just below the average rating of 1500 and a finals change of ~40%. Essendon, North and St Kilda fell away this round and now comfortably ‘below average’ teams, along with winners Freo and Bulldogs.</p>
<p>It also looks like we can rule a line through Gold Coast, Brisbane and Carlton who are all projected below 7 wins for the year.</p>
