Stupid Thursday game caught me out again. Will update when I get a chance.

**UPDATE** I've now added in the match importance ratings for each game. By far the most important game was the Thursday night epic between Hawthorn and Sydney. I'll write a bit more about that in the review but that match had approximately a 40 percentage point change in top 4 chances for each team.

The next most important involves Port Adelaide and North Melbourne, the two sides sitting in 8th and 9th. While North are much better chances to stay in the 8, a loss to Port this week sees those chances shift further into Port Adelaide favour, with a ~25 percentage point swing either way based on the match.
