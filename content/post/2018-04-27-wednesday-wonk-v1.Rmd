For those who are part....

First, let's grab the results using `fitzRoy`. 

```{r}
library(fitzRoy)
library(tidyverse)

results <- get_match_results()

glimpse(results)
#squiggle <- get_squiggle_data("tips")
#tail(squiggle)

```

Now, first thing - how many draws have occured. To show that, we need to create a `result` column that contains `win`, `loss` or `draw`.

```{r}
results <- results %>%
  mutate(Result = case_when(
    Margin < 0 ~ "Loss",
    Margin > 0 ~ "Win",
    TRUE ~ "Draw"
  ))

results %>%
  group_by(Result) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            perc = n/nrow(results) * 100)

```

So, across all history, about 1% of games end up in a draw. Incidentally, this also shows the long term home team result breakdown with ~59% winning rate. 

```{r}


```
