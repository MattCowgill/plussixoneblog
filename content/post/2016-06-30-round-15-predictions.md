I've been caught out by the Thursday game so I won't have a chance to write a preview until tomorrow. Here are the predictions anyway!

**UPDATE:** So I've got around to taking a bit of a closer look at this rounds matches.

Finally we reach our last bye round - I know I'm looking forward to getting to a full round of matches. There are a few tight matches according to our [ELO model](http://plussixoneblog.com/2016/05/23/my-elo-rating-system-explained/), however the tight matches all appear pretty meaningless according to our [Match Importance](http://plussixoneblog.com/2016/06/16/beyond-the-8-point-game-estimating-match-importance-in-the-afl/) metric.

By far and away the most important match this round is the Syd v WB match - having big implications for both teams top 4 chances. I had a nice discussion this week with @Matterofstats on twitter about that measure - he suggested trying to weight the value of importance based on the likelihood of it occurring. I hope to implement that this week but I encourage anyone to jump on and have a read of his methodology.
