I'm stuck in an airport without my laptop so this preview will be super short I'm sorry!

As always, the tips, simulations and ratings live in the link on the side bar.

It was one of the hardest rounds my model has seen. It was unable to pick a winner in tonight's match, as well as the North v Collingwood Game. Four other games also give the favoured team less than a 6 pointadvantage .
Happy Tipping!
